# Instant-QFF
This repository contains the customized Instant-NGP codebased for QFF: Quantized Fourier Features. 
QFF allows real-time rendering of NeRF models in a web-browser, without any post-processing process (e.g., baking).
QFF also trains roughly on the same speed of HashGrid, using similar file size. 

Please refer to the technical paper for the details.

## Installation
Please follow the original installation instructions for the Instant-NGP repository. 
One major modification from the original repository is the use of modified [tiny-cuda-nn](https://github.com/leejaeyong7/tiny-cuda-nn) repository which contains the QFF implementation.
Since the submodules are set using the correct commit, simply installing the NGP repository should suffice. 

## Running
To train the model with the QFF, please

For interactive run, please use
```bash
./instant-ngp --config configs/nerf/qff.json data/nerf/fox
```

For python based headless run, please use
```bash
python scripts/run.py --network configs/nerf/qff.json --scene data/nerf/fox --save_snapshot PATH_TO_SAVE_INGP_FILE

```


## Visualizing the runs
We provide a code to translate trained `ingp` files into a render friendly format. 
```bash
python scripts/parse_ingp.py --ingp_file PATH_TO_SAVED_INGP_FILE --output_path PATH_TO_OUTPUT_FILES
```

Because this repository is intended for training only, we provide visualization code in a [separate]() repository.
